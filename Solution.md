<h3>Logic for the final code</h3>

#### To deduce the six-digit code:

Each hidden key has a two-digit number.

The first digit represents the order in which the key appears.

The second digit is the key itself.

#### Example

If a key shows "57":

5: Indicates this key comes in the 5th position.

7: Is the actual key.

Arrange all keys in order based on their first digit to form the final six-digit code (371469).
